Scrutiny
=========

A simple auth/fail2ban log parser written in Python 3. Stores parsed log data in a DB. Currently only does IPv4.

Seems Fedora 21 has a version of python-systemd that you can't get off PyPi?

TO DO
-------------------------
- Probably should use things like zgrep and awk... probably quicker. Should time it and double check
- IPv6
